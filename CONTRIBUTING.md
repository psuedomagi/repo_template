# Introduction

### Contributions Welcome

Thank you for considering contributing to this repo! 

### We encourage all contributions

**We welcome any kind of contribution. You can improve documentation, triage bugs, write tutorials, fix small and large mistakes, add features, or refactor the whole shebang.**

# Ground Rules

> Responsibilities
>
> * No code snobbery allowed. Everyone starts somewhere; help, guide, mentor if you know a better, cleaner, way.
> * Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
> * Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
> * Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
> * Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

# Your First Contribution

If you've never contributed to a project before, this guide should help you get started: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

All contributions big and small start with an issue. Use the provided templates in [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/). Clearly explain what the problem or proposed feature is, and how you think it should work.

1. If you want to suggest a major overhaul, fork the code, make your changes, and when you're happy with them, submit a pull request with the issue number.
2. For smaller changes, work in a branch and submit a pull request referencing the issue number when ready.

**Please use the provided [pull request template](/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) in the .github folder for all PRs.**

The maintainer(s) will regularly review pull requests and approve them after review. If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
